# Monte Carlo Simulation for Smartphone Market Share prediction of four companies.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore Monte Carlo Simulation in determining future “Global Smartphone Market Share” based on historical statistical trends of companies and different random factors affecting the market share.

## Description
Our research takes into consideration four leaders in the industry which are Samsung, Apple, Huawei, and LG, based on their performance over the last five years predictions are made for the future projections.

The research process involved running 10,000 simulations for each year for the next five years to derive the statistical value of market share for each company based on the input factors and random variables.

## Hypotheses
The research involves testing hypothesis based on input parameters and random variables using Monte Carlo Simulation. Following are the three hypotheses which will be tested based on the simulations:

1. Change in Market Share of a company should be more with relatively higher number of new inventions in a given timeframe.
2. An increase in service partnerships should have a positive impact on company’s market share.
3. If a company sees a rise in number of countries it is active in, it should affect the market share positively. 

## Historical Data and Random Variables
Historical Data: 
Historical Data comprises of four input factors: Market Share, Revenue, Profit Margin, and Research and Development Expenditure. The data for previous five years are taken as input data for each of the four companies. These input factors are currently assigned equal weightage scores.

Random Variables:
Random variables are the factors which are not associated with any fixed pattern and can change year on year basis depending upon the real world activities of the companies. Random variable consists of:  New technological inventions per year, Number of Service Partnership company has in each year, and Number of countries where the company is active in. 

Brief Description of Random Variables:
New inventions- Score for a company increases if it had a new invention in that particular year and it decreases if no new invention has occurred in past two years.

Service Partnership- Score will be adversely affected if service partnership has ended and it will increase if the company manages to add new service partners.

Active Countries- Score for the companies depends on their presence in different countries across the globe. If a company has more presence it’s score will be better than companies with less presence. 

## Results

Hypothesis 1 tested : Tested Company sees the largest increase in market share when the new inventions are more than other companies.

Hypothesis 2 tested : Tested Company's market share increases with more service partnerships compared to other companies.

Hypothesis 3 tested : Huawei with higher number of active countries had the steepest increase in market share compared to other companies which were active in less countries.
